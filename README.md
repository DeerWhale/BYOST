# BYOST (Build Your Own Spectral Template)

Using Principal component analysis (PCA) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to build a spectral template based on two conditions (such as time and light-curve-shape parameter). 
This work is initially developped to construct the NIR spectral template of type Ia supernovae using the data obtained by CSP-II, see our [publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05998) for details. 

If you used this package for your research work, please kindly cite [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05998), much appriciated! :)

## Installation
```
pip install BYOST
```
